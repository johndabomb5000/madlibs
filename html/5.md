# HTML Inputs

## Getting Started

HTML inputs allow us to capture input from users, which we can grab with JavaScript and use to manipulate the page.

## What's Covered in This Lesson 

1. HTML input syntax

## HTML Inputs

```html
<input type="text">
```

Inputs can have many different types, but we'll focus on text for right now. We can also give inputs class names to make them easier to access with JavaScript:

```html
<input class="input-1" type="text">
```

We'll learn how to read inputs values with JavaScript later. For now, let's move on to CSS!
